;; A mad scientist with tenure has created an experiment
;; tracking mice in a maze. Several mazes have been
;; randomly generated, and you've been tasked with writing
;; a program to determine the mazes in which it's possible
;; for the mouse to reach the cheesy endpoint. Write a
;; function which accepts a maze in the form of a
;; collection of rows, each row is a string where:
;; * spaces represent areas where the mouse can walk
;; freely
;; * hashes (#) represent walls where the mouse can not
;; walk
;; * M represents the mouse's starting point
;; * C represents the cheese which the mouse must reach
;; The mouse is not allowed to travel diagonally in the
;; maze (only up/down/left/right), nor can he escape the
;; edge of the maze. Your function must return true iff
;; the maze is solvable by the mouse.
