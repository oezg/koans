;; Difficulty: Hard
;; Tags: [numbers]
;; 
;; Given a pair of numbers, the start and end point, find
;; a path between the two using only three possible
;; operations:
;; * double
;; * halve (odd numbers cannot be halved)
;; * add 2
;; 
;; Find the shortest path through the "maze". Because
;; there are multiple shortest paths, you must return the
;; length of the shortest path, not the path itself.
