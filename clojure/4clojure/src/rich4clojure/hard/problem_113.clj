;; Write a function that takes a variable number of
;; integer arguments. If the output is coerced into a
;; string, it should return a comma (and space) separated
;; list of the inputs sorted smallest to largest. If the
;; output is coerced into a sequence, it should return a
;; seq of unique input elements in the same order as they
;; were entered.
