;; By 4Clojure user: shockbob

;; Tags: [game]
;; 
;; As in Problem 73, a tic-tac-toe board is represented by
;; a two dimensional vector. X is represented by :x, O is
;; represented by :o, and empty is represented by :e.
;; Create a function that accepts a game piece and board
;; as arguments, and returns a set (possibly empty) of all
;; valid board placements of the game piece which would
;; result in an immediate win.
;; 
;; 
;; Board coordinates should be as in calls to get-in. For
;; example, [0 1] is the topmost row, center position.
