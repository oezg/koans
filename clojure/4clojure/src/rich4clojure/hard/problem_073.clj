;; A tic-tac-toe board is represented by a two dimensional
;; vector. X is represented by :x, O is represented by :o,
;; and empty is represented by :e. A player wins by
;; placing three Xs or three Os in a horizontal, vertical,
;; or diagonal row. Write a function which analyzes a
;; tic-tac-toe board and returns :x if X has won, :o if O
;; has won, and nil if neither player has won.
