;; Happy numbers are positive integers that follow a
;; particular formula: take each individual digit, square
;; it, and then sum the squares to get a new number.
;; Repeat with the new number and eventually, you might
;; get to a number whose squared sum is 1. This is a happy
;; number. An unhappy number (or sad number) is one that
;; loops endlessly. Write a function that determines if a
;; number is happy or not.
