  "Everyone loves triangles, and it's easy to understand why&mdash;they're so wonderfully symmetric (except scalenes, they suck).\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nYour passion for triangles has led you to become a miner (and part-time Clojure programmer) where you work all day to chip out isosceles-shaped minerals from rocks gathered in a nearby open-pit mine.  There are too many rocks coming from the mine to harvest them all so you've been tasked with writing a program to analyze the mineral patterns of each rock, and determine which rocks have the biggest minerals.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nSomeone has already written a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision\">computer-vision</a> system for the mine.

  "<p>A standard American deck of playing cards has four suits - spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs - and thirteen cards in each suit. Two is the lowest rank, followed by other integers up to ten; then the jack, queen, king, and ace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's convenient for humans to represent these cards as suit/rank pairs, such as H5 or DQ: the heart five and diamond queen respectively. But these forms are not convenient for programmers, so to write a card game you need some way to parse an input string into meaningful components. For purposes of determining rank, we will define the cards to be valued from 0 (the two) to 12 (the ace)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Write a function which converts (for example) the string \"SJ\" into a map of <code>{:suit :spade, :rank 9}</code>. A ten will always be represented with the single character \"T\", rather than the two characters \"10\".</p>",
