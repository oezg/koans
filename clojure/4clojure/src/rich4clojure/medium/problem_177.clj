;; When parsing a snippet of code it's often a good idea
;; to do a sanity check to see if all the brackets match
;; up. Write a function that takes in a string and returns
;; truthy if all square [] round () and curly {} brackets
;; are properly paired and legally nested, or returns
;; falsey otherwise.
